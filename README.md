# Android Silencer

Android Silencer is an Android application created in response to a feature loss in Android 2.2.  It allows easy swapping of the "Vibrate" and "Silent" ringer modes.

The application is most useful to users who primarily use vibrate mode on their phones.  With the touch of a button, vibrate mode is easily swapped to silent mode, and with another press, it is swapped back.
